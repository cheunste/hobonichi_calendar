Ever used a Hobonichi Journal? Ever wished you can slap some photos to the calendar pages but it was too much of a chore to shrink photos, and then print them? Well, this is a series of python scripts might be the solution you're looking for

What this hobonichi_calendar projects does is take a series of photos, shrinks them to the appropriate hobonichi calendar size, and then outputs one image that you can then print on a 8.5"X11" paper (or whatever size)
